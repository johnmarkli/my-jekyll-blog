So I've recently started a job doing development for healthcare apps at UHN.
Needless to say, I spent a great deal of time setting up the perfect dev
enviornment with all the tools needed to get the job done in the most efficient
way possible. I'm a tool snob and I'm constantly trying to find better ways to
do simple things.

<lh>Here are the key parts to my system (which I'll go into more detail
below):</lh>
- Text Editor - MacVim
- Shell - zsh
- Package Manager - Homebrew

### Text Editor
<lh>MacVim</lh>
Vim is the shit. It just takes a bit of pain, sweat, and tears to make it the shit.

### Shell
<lh>zsh</lh>
zsh has some simple tweaks to make it more usable than bash and after using it,
its hard to go back to bash's lack of features.

### Package Manager
<lh>Homebrew</lh>
Homebrew is a must-have for any Mac dev environment. It's simple and gets the
job done with little fuss. Need the latest version? No problem, just do a brew
update.

### Other useful tools
<lh>Mac Specific:</lh>
- Alfred - Open stuff quick and easy from the keyboard.
- Better Touch Tool - Gives Mac OS the one feature I miss from windows. Easy
  window snapping and maximization.
- Bartender - Helps organize the menu bar which can easily get clogged with
  marginally useful icons.
