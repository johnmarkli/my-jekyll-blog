My most recent quest has been to find the perfect keyboard. This all started when I realized I really need that control key that my wireless Mac keyboard was missing.

Don't get me wrong, the Mac keyboard is a beautiful piece of hardware and its the perfect keyboard for just about anybody.

But I'm not anybody. I like things a certain way.

<lh>Thus I've embarked on a search for the perfect keyboard. Here are my criteria:</lh>
- tenkeyless - I cherish desktop space and I can't remember the last time I really needed the numpad
- mechanical - After trying the different types of cherry switches I've settled on the Browns. They seem to give the best balance of typing feel and relative quientness.

<lh>And that's actually about it. Here's the shortlist:</lh>
- CM Storm Quick Fire Rapid - brown switches not readily available
- Razer Tournament Stealh Edition - not out yet
- China brands - not that much cheaper so might as well get a name brand here
